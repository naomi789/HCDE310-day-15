# HCDE310-day-15
For today's assignment, please: 
1. Instead of looping through all the fruit, change the code in `app.py` so it only displays
 - Fruit that starts with the letter “o” AND you have less than 3 of
2. Edit the `.gitignore` file so you ignore `keys.py`
3. Add two (fake) keys to that file: `MY_SECRET_API_KEY_1 = "SUPERSECRET"` and `MY_SECRET_API_KEY_2 = "SUPERSUPERSECRET"`
4. Reference those keys from your `app.py` file (e.g., print them to the console with `print(keys.MY_SECRET_API_KEY_1)` and `print(keys.MY_SECRET_API_KEY_2)`
